/**
 * This is a helper file to work around the "vite not found" error.
 * 
 * The issue occurs when Vite isn't properly accessible in the PATH.
 * This can happen for various reasons:
 * 1. Vite isn't installed globally
 * 2. node_modules/.bin is not in PATH
 * 3. Package installation is incomplete
 * 
 * To resolve this issue:
 * - Make sure all dependencies are installed with: npm install or yarn install
 * - You can run Vite directly with: npx vite or ./node_modules/.bin/vite
 * - For a global install: npm install -g vite

/**
 * Common troubleshooting steps:
 * 
 * 1. Run 'npm install' to ensure all dependencies are installed
 * 2. Try running 'npx vite' instead of 'npm run dev'
 * 3. Check if node_modules/.bin/vite exists
 * 4. Ensure your PATH includes node_modules/.bin
